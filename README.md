# Prosper Loan Data Exploration

## Dataset

The data consists of information regarding the data collected by Prosper for granting loans to Borrowers.

Of the 81 differnet variables that is collected by Prosper Loans, Specific variables such as Loan status, 
Borrower rate, Loan original amount, Occupation, Employment status, Home owner, credit score( upper and lower),
Monthly income, Borrower APR, Listing category, and Term were used for the investigation and visualisation process 

## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, I found that there was a strong correlation between Borrower rate and Borrowe Annual Percentage Rate (APR) 
and weak relationship between Borrower rate and the range of upper and lower credit scores. The top 10 occupation of borrowers were:
'Other', Professional, Computer Programmer, Executive, Teacher, Administrative Assistant, Analyst, Sales - Commision, Accountant/CPA and Clerical.

I also found out that majority of the people who took loan used it for debt consolidation with 52.9% of the borrowers being homeowners.

The people who selected their occupation as 'other' appears to take the highest amount of loan with more people taking up t0 35000 as compared to other professions. Skilled labour and administrative assistant took the least amount of loan from range 4500-15000.

It is difficult to estimate and compare the relationship of executives with all of the other variables in the dataset due to lack to availability of data.

More options needs to be provided to borrowers who filled 'other' as their profession or should be given a priviledge to write what their profession is as this will enable better understanding of the interactions
Majority of the borrowers used it for debt consolidation
No loan status past due was more than 120 months
Most of the analyst are home owners who take long time loan


## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focus majorly on the Top 10 occupation and the Top 10 Listing Category of Prosper Loan. 
I start by introducing the data that Prosper use for their business process, followed by the overview of the dataset.

Afterwards, I introduce the visualisation of the Top 10 occupation of borrowers and Top 10 loan lisiting category, 
each of the categorical variables. Further more, I introduced a heat map that showed the correlation between all 
the quantitative data while showing how strong or weak the relationships are. Finally, I introduced a boxplot that showed
the visualisation of the relationship between Occupation of borrowers and Loan Original Amount.
